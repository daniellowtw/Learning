# Qt Designer

This chapter is about using an IDE to create the UI.

Requirements:

* [Qt Creator](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-6)
* PySide tooling (pyside-uic)

The workflow is roughly as follows:

* Create a new .ui file using Qt Designer which is integrated in Qt Creator
* Save the .ui file
* Convert to .py file using pyside-uic: `pyside-uic <input> -o <output>`
* Create a subclass that inherits from the type of widget as well as the widget py file. e.g.

class FindAndReplaceDlg(QDialog, ui_findandreplacedlg.Ui_FindAndReplaceDlg):
